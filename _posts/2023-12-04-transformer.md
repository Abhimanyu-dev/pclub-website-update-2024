# Sumarizzing

This project provided a comprehensive exploration of deep learning concepts in an offline mode, seamlessly combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation. Mentees engaged in hands-on projects, utilizing RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, dedicating 10-12 hours per week to enhance their skills.

Key Learning Points:
1. *Deep Learning Theory:* Delved into the fundamentals, including activation functions, loss functions, and perceptrons.

2. *Backpropagation:* Gained a solid grasp of the concept and intuition behind backpropagation in neural networks.

3. *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):* Understood the basics of RNNs, exploring their applications and intricacies.

4. *LSTMs and GRUs:* Implemented and comprehended Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit networks for sequential data.

5. *Attention Mechanisms:* Explored the use of attention mechanisms, a crucial aspect in enhancing neural network performance.

6. *Candlestick Patterns and Technical Indicators:* Applied deep learning to analyze stock market trends using candlestick patterns and technical indicators.

7. *Trading Strategies:* Implemented renowned trading strategies grounded in the analysis of technical indicators to navigate the stock market effectively.

This program required a foundation in basic linear algebra, proficiency in object-oriented programming using Python, and an understanding of basic regression and classification machine learning algorithms. Participants joined us in unraveling the intricacies of deep learning and its applications in the financial domain.
