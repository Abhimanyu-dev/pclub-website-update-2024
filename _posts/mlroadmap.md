# Machine Learning Roadmap

## Introduction
Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn from data. This roadmap will help you start your journey in ML.

## Basics
- Learn Python
- Basic Statistics and Probability
- Linear Algebra and Calculus

## Core Concepts
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Advanced Topics
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Model Deployment and Production

## Resources
- Courses (Coursera, edX, Udacity)
- Books (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop, Deep Learning by Goodfellow)
